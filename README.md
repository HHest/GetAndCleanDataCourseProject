# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This is an exercise in creating a tidy data set from some collection of data.

The repository contains:

* This `README.md` file.
* A code book `CodeBook.md`, which gives the source of the original data, and a description of the collated data, including the list of variables. The code book also provides a description of the transformations done on the original data to form the final data sets.
* The `R` script `run_analysis.R` used to create the final data sets.

The `R` script assumes that the original data set is uncompressed (with the directory structure intact) into the same directory that contains the script.
