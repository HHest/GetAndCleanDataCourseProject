# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This is an exercise in creating a tidy data set from some collection of data.

The repository contains:

* This `README.md` file.
* A code book `CodeBook.md`, which gives the location of the original data, and a description of the final collated data, including the list of variables. The code book also provides a description of the transformations done on the original data to form the final data sets.
* The `R` script `run_analysis.R` used to create the final data sets, the second of which is submitted for peer assessment.

The `R` script assumes that the original data set is uncompressed (with the directory structure intact) into the same directory that contains the script. Please see the "Transformations" section of the code book for an outline of the steps taken by the script in doing its work.
